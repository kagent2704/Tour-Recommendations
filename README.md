# Tour-Recommendations
INTRODUCTION
In an era where travel experiences are increasingly personalized and curated, the demand for intelligent, user centric solutions have never been greater.
By considering factors such as the time of year, destination, preferred activities and budget, the website will guide users toward the perfect travel experience. Whether someone is looking for a winter getaway, a spring time festival, or a summer adventure, the website will ensure they find the right tour at the right time.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
In today’s travel industry, travellers seek experiences tailored to their preferences, lifestyle, and budget. However, with numerous destinations and year-round activities, many struggle to find the ideal vacation. Traditional tour selection methods fail to adapt to seasonal highlights and individual preferences, resulting in frustration and missed opportunities for richer experiences.
The problem lies in the lack of a comprehensive, user-centric solution that helps travellers choose ideal vacations based on real-time factors such as seasonality, activities, and budget, ensuring they maximize both enjoyment and value.

OBJECTIVE OF PROPOSED WORK
With the Tour Recommendations Website, we aim to provide users with a one stop solution that solves their dilemma of choosing a perfect vacation destination. Tailored to comply to every individual’s unique preference, we offer seasonal touring combinations to explore Picturesque India! We rely on a seasonal segregation so that our users can have perfectly curated travel expeditions that provide the richest possible experiences during the right seasons of the year.
